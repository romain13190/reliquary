# under the victim's hotkey — that anti-DoS property is preserved.
#
# This cap closes a follow-on side-channel discovered in the wild: the
# zero-quota bad-envelope channel was being used by the LEGITIMATE
# hotkey owner to warm HTTP/1.1 keep-alive connections at zero quota
# cost (fire ~24 bogus POSTs to prime sockets, then ride the warm
# connections for the real signed POSTs and gain a ~20-30 ms RTT edge
# on the seal-trigger race against honest single-instance miners).
#
# Two defences combine in the fix:
#   1. ``Connection: close`` is set on every BAD_ENVELOPE_SIGNATURE
#      response, so the warm-up cannot happen (server tears the socket
#      down immediately; attacker pays handshake on the next packet).
#   2. This per-hotkey cap bounds bandwidth and verdict-ring noise even
#      against an attacker who doesn't care about priming — past the cap
#      the response is still BAD_ENVELOPE_SIGNATURE but the verdict is
#      no longer appended to the per-hotkey ring (which would otherwise
#      let a spoofer flood the victim's ``/verdicts/{hotkey}`` history
#      with junk that displaces legitimate entries).
#
# Crucially the per-hotkey rate-limit quota is never moved by these
# rejects, so PR #35's invariant holds end-to-end: an anonymous spoofer
# firing N bad packets against victim V's hotkey writes at most
# ``MAX_BAD_ENVELOPE_PER_HOTKEY_PER_WINDOW`` verdict-ring entries and
# burns N handshakes, but V's full legitimate quota is untouched.

# bug strongly suggests intent.

# ``miner_hotkey`` and exhaust the per-window counter — locking the real

#
# Why zero is safe now
# --------------------
# The two reasons the tolerance was widened in earlier iterations are
# both eliminated by the v2.3 fixes on this branch:
#
#   * Worker-side dequeue lag (PR #31 → tol=10). The seal/drand re-check
#     used to run on the worker, minutes after arrival under GRAIL queue
#     backpressure. Removed by the arrival-time refactor — drand is now
#     checked only once at HTTP arrival, against the middleware-stamped
#     ``t_arrival``.
#   * RTT boundary crossing (commit 8b7f483 → tol=1). A miner firing at
#     t=2.99 s of round R would land at the validator at t=3.00 s of
#     R+1. Well-behaved miners are expected to apply a small boundary-
#     safety margin client-side and sleep past the boundary if their
#     corrected clock is within a few hundred ms of one. With both
#     sides NTP-synced and the miner respecting the safety window, no
#     honest submission should land in the wrong drand round.
#
# Anything > 0 here opens an antedating window: an attacker could claim
# a slightly-earlier chronological tier than they actually earned. With
# zero, the only path to a slot is to actually be there in time —
# matches the original v2.3 design intent. Operators can re-widen via
# the ``DRAND_ROUND_BACKWARD_TOLERANCE`` env var if their cross-continent
# RTT profile justifies it (e.g. validators in EU serving miners in AU
# may need 1-2 to absorb 100-300 ms RTT spillover around a boundary).
# Tests pin specific values explicitly via
# ``GrpoWindowBatcher(drand_round_backward_tolerance=...)``.

# that attaches round R+1 hasn't seen σ_{R+1} yet, so they're cheating).
