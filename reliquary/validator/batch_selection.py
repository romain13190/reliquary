"""Drand-round-anchored batch selection + emission distribution (design A').

Called once per window at seal time. Two things happen here:

1. **Pick the B distinct prompts that go into the training step.** Order is
   driven by the drand round each miner attached at submit time. Submissions
   are bucketed into 3-second slots (one drand quicknet round per slot);
   earlier slots fill the batch first. Within a slot, distinct prompts are
   admitted in a canonical hash order so two validators with different
   in-memory orderings still agree.

2. **Compute the emission distribution.** Each filled slot is worth
   ``pool / B``. Within a slot, the K miners who submitted for that
   ``(round, prompt)`` split that share equally. So a miner sybiling the
   same prompt with N hotkeys in the same drand round earns N × (1/N) =
   identical total payout to a single hotkey — registration costs make
   sybiling strictly wasteful.

Unfilled slots burn their share (no redistribution). This keeps emission
math simple and stable; partial fills happen when miner activity is low,
and the burn appears in the on-chain weight setter as missing weight for
that window.

v2.3+: replaces the v2.2 pure-FIFO ``select_batch``.

        submissions: all GRAIL-validated submissions for the window, in

            was already validated at accept time.
        b: training batch size (= B_BATCH). Equals the number of slots in
            the emission pool.
        cooldown_map: read-only view of which prompts are in cooldown.
            Prompts in cooldown are skipped entirely.
        current_window: needed to evaluate cooldown.
        pool: total emission budget for the window. Each filled slot pays
            ``pool / b`` (NOT ``pool / filled_slots`` — under-filled
            windows burn unused share rather than redistributing).

    Returns:
        (training_batch, rewards_by_hotkey)
        - training_batch: up to ``b`` submissions, one per filled slot. The
          canonical representative for each ``(round, prompt)`` slot is the
          submission with the smallest ``_within_slot_key`` (= deterministic
          across validators).
        - rewards_by_hotkey: dict hotkey → float. Sums to (slots_filled / b)
          × pool, with unfilled slots burned.

    Boundary-round fair split
    -------------------------
    When iterating rounds in ascending order, the round that first brings
    ``len(training_batch)`` past ``b`` is the "boundary round". Earlier
    code stopped the moment ``b`` was reached, which meant: within the
    boundary round, only the prompts with the smallest canonical hashes
    got slots, and every other miner in that same drand-3-s bucket
    earned zero. That's unfair — those miners arrived at the same
    chronological tier; the canonical hash is just a tiebreaker, not a
    priority.

    The boundary round now distributes its share fairly across ALL
    prompts in it:

      per_prompt_boundary = remaining_slots × slot_share / N_prompts_in_round
      per_miner_on_prompt = per_prompt_boundary / K_p

    Total emission paid in the boundary round equals
    ``remaining_slots × slot_share`` (= exactly what the boundary round
    is "worth"). The training batch still trains on
    ``remaining_slots`` prompts (canonical hash order) — that's just an
    implementation cap on training cost, not an economic statement.

    Sybil invariants preserved:
      * Same-prompt sybil neutral: K hotkeys on one prompt split the
        per_prompt share K-way, total payout per prompt is fixed
        independent of K.
      * Different-prompt sybil tax: K hotkeys on K different prompts in
        the boundary round each earn per_prompt_boundary, registration
        burn is the tax.
      * Conservation: total reward paid in boundary round equals what
        a full non-boundary round would have paid for the same slot
        count.

    Does NOT mutate ``cooldown_map`` — the caller records post-selection.
