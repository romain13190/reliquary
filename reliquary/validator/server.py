"""FastAPI server: receives v2 GRPO market submissions, exposes window state.

/submit drops requests on an asyncio queue (worker thread drains it off the
event loop so GRAIL verification doesn't block HTTP responses). Under
TestClient (no worker running), /submit runs synchronously so tests see
the real verdict.

/verdicts/{hotkey} surfaces the real per-submission verdicts (accept /
specific reject reason) that ``/submit`` cannot return in real time. Under
the production worker path /submit replies with a provisional ``SUBMITTED``
sentinel and the actual verdict lands in this endpoint a few seconds later,
once the worker has run the full verification pipeline. Miners learn the
truth without having to wait minutes for the R2 archive upload.
