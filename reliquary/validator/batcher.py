        ``t_arrival`` is the wall-clock time at which the request was
        received by the validator's HTTP server (stamped by the ASGI
        ``stamp_arrival`` middleware in ``server.py``). When provided, it
        is used to compute the "current" round instead of ``time.time()``
        at call time. This decouples the round check from validator-side
        processing latency: if the asyncio loop stalls for N seconds
        (trainer GIL contention, GRAIL queue backpressure, pydantic body
        parsing on the loop), a submission that arrived at the validator
        within its round is still accepted, because the round is computed
        as of the arrival timestamp, not as of when the handler finally
        runs. Without this, an honest submission that landed inside its
        round can become STALE_ROUND purely because the validator was
        busy when the handler executed.

        Falls back to ``self._wall_clock()`` if ``t_arrival`` is None
        (e.g. the worker-path re-check inside ``_accept_locked`` called
        directly, tests that don't go through the HTTP layer).

        Forward direction is zero-tolerance: a miner that attaches round
        R+1 hasn't seen σ_{R+1} yet (σ_R is the freshest signed beacon by
        definition), so claiming a future round is unrecoverable cheating
        and always rejected as FUTURE_ROUND.

        Backward direction allows up to
        ``self.drand_round_backward_tolerance`` rounds (default 1 = 3 s).
        This absorbs:
          * HTTP RTT + queue/scheduling jitter that pushes a POST across
            a drand boundary mid-flight (miner fires at t=2.9 s of round
            R, validator receives at t=3.0 s of round R+1)
          * Small wall-clock skew between miner and validator. v2.3's
            original zero-tolerance was correct in spec but turned every
            inter-round POST into a STALE_ROUND in prod.
        The security cost is bounded: an attacker can antedate by at most
        ``tolerance`` rounds (3 s × tolerance) of chronological priority,
        which is uniform across honest and malicious miners alike.
        Combined with arrival-time stamping, the backward tolerance can
        now be tightened safely (the wide default existed to absorb loop
        stalls — that's no longer needed on the HTTP path).

        Public so the HTTP /submit handler can run it pre-queue and

        passes. After this point HTTP cheap-reject starts rejecting
        submissions whose ``drand_round > _seal_trigger_round`` as
        BATCH_FILLED, so the queue can only lose items from here on.

        Phase 2 — queue drain. Poll ``_queue_drained_predicate`` every
        ~200 ms until it returns True. Only THEN do we fire the seal.
        Without this phase, GRAIL-pending submissions queued during the

        ``is_sealed`` check the instant the seal fires — defeating the
        entire boundary-fair-split design. The drain phase guarantees
        every queued trigger-round submission contributes to the seal
        batch's emission distribution.

        Defensive fallback: if the drand chain info isn't available
        (synchronous tests that disable the drand check), the boundary
        wait is skipped and seal fires immediately. If the predicate is
        None (tests that don't wire one), the drain wait is also
        skipped. Both fallbacks preserve pre-v2.3 timing for test
        fixtures that don't exercise the full pipeline.

        Cancellation: if the service swaps the active batcher (window
        rolls over) while this coroutine is sleeping, the task is
        cancelled by the loop teardown. That's fine — a stale batcher's
