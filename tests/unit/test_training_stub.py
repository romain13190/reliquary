"""train_step — basic interface tests (no real model required).

These tests cover the stable interface contract: empty-batch is a no-op,
the model reference is always returned, and a non-empty batch with no
valid rollouts still returns cleanly. The full math is tested in
test_training_grpo.py and test_training_rollout_loss.py.
