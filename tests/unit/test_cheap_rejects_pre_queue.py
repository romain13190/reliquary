"""Cheap rejects pre-queue on the /submit HTTP handler.

Every reject reason that depends only on O(1) batcher state must be
returned synchronously by the HTTP handler, BEFORE the request hits the
async worker queue. Without this, a STALE_ROUND or WRONG_CHECKPOINT
submission has to wait in line behind ~5–25 s GRAIL forward passes of
honest submissions ahead of it in the queue — minutes of latency on what
should be a microsecond rejection.

These tests pin the contract: each reject reason returns synchronously
on /submit, and the submit_queue is NOT populated (the worker never sees
the request).
